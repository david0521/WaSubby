00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.940 align:middle line:84%
subs2

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to provide additional
or interpretive

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.070 align:middle line:84%
information to individuals
who wish to access it.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Captions are necessary so
the deaf and hard of hearing

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
can access the audio portion
of video presentations.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.890 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll see how
to add captions to a video.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Hey everyone.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.492 align:middle line:84%
I'm Bob Bailey,
and in this video

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll learn how to add captions
to a video using the Media

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:90%
module.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's start by
looking at an example.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Notice as the video plays
I can click the CC button

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:90%
and select a language.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
This video is configured
with both English and Spanish

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:90%
captions.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
To add captions
to a video you'll

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
need caption files for each
language you want to support.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The Brightcove player
supports WebVTT, SRT, DFXP,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:90%
and SCC formats.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you have caption files,
the text track property

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
for the video needs to be set
to the caption file location.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get caption
files for our videos.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
You really have a
couple of options.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:84%
You can use a Brightcove partner
to generate the caption files

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:84%
or you can create the
caption files yourself.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:84%
In this video, we'll
look at both options.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Using a Brightcove
partner is the easiest way

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:90%
to add captions to videos.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
For all of our Video
Cloud training videos,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:84%
we use our partner 3Play Media
to generate the caption files.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
If I log into my
3Play Media account.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I can see a list of all my Video
Cloud videos inside my account.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
To integrate 3Play Media
with my Video Cloud account,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:90%
I've set up a linked account.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And then provided some
Video Cloud credentials

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
which allow 3Play Media to
access my Video Cloud videos.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:84%
This allows them to
pull videos directly

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:84%
from my Video Cloud
account without me having

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.840 align:middle line:90%
to upload videos to them.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Once they have my video,
they generate the captions

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and then set the text track
properties for the video

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:90%
using the Video Cloud CMS API.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back
to the Media module

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and select a video that was
processed using 3Play Media.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
If I go look at the
text track properties,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I can see this video
has English captions.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
If I look at the text
track properties.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
You can see the caption file
is being hosted by 3Play Media.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
By using a partner that provides
integration with Video Cloud

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
all I have to do is indicate
which videos I want captions

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
for and they create the
captions file and set

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
the text track property for
the video automatically.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at
another option.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
In this case I'll assume that
someone used a third party

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
software package to generate
the caption files for me,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and what I need to do is go in
and manually configure the text

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
track properties myself.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
For this example, we're going
to add English and Spanish

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:90%
captions to a video.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Notice I have two caption files.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you need to
have a separate captions

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
file for each language
you want to support.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:84%
If we look at one of
the caption files.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:84%
You can see it has time
markings in the text to be

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:90%
displayed during that time.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Now that we have caption files.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We can set the text tracks
property for the video.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll go back to
the Media module,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
open my video properties,
and edit the text tracks.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
You have a couple
of options here.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
You can select file upload
and browse for a caption file

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
on your local file system.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
You can select URL upload,
to upload a caption file that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
exists out on a
publicly addressable URL

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
or select remote URL and specify
a location to a remote caption

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:90%
file.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
With the first two
options, Video Cloud

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
will be hosting
the caption file.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The last option assumes you
have the caption file hosted

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:90%
at a publicly addressable URL.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to select file upload
and then browse and select

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:90%
the English caption file.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll enter the language code
for the file, which is en.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
The label is what will appear in
the player to allow the viewer

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:90%
to select his language.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:90%
I'll add English.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Finally I'll set the
kind to captions.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
The default option is used to
indicate the default track.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Note the default setting should
only be set for one language.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
When I'm done I'll
click add text track.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Let me go ahead and add the
Spanish captions as well.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:90%
When I'm done, I'll click Save.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Now the text tracks
will not appear here

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
until the processing
has finished.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll just update
the page and you

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:84%
could see the texture
properties have been set.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's test this to make sure
the captions are working.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll publish the video and
then click on the player URL.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll play the video.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And if I hover
over the CC button,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I can see I have both
English and Spanish captions.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:90%
